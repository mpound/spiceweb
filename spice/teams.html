							<h4>Matteo Bonato</h4>
							<p>INAF-IRA Bologna</p>
							<p>Matteo an infrared and radio astrophysicist. His research activity has been mostly focused on galaxy/AGN co-evolution. He worked out an evolutionary model which has the unique feature in providing a self-consistent description of the IR-to-mm spectro-photometric properties of galaxies as a whole, i.e. taking into account simultaneously the contributions from both star-formation and nuclear activity across the galaxy lifetime. This tool allowed him to work out predictions for photometric and spectroscopic surveys and pointed observations with instruments such as SPICA, JWST, OST, CORE and PICO. He also extended its galaxy/AGN evolutionary model to the radio regime. Such extension has been exploited to produce simulations for deep radio surveys with the SKA. He has also studied the physical properties and the evolution of star-forming galaxies and of radio-loud and radio-quiet AGNs using ALMA, LOFAR and WSRT data.</p>
